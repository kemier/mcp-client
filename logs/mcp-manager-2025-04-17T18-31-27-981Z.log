[2025-04-17T18:32:17.971Z] [INFO] [ChatViewProvider] - Updating chat with message: I apologize, but I don't have real-time information about the current time in Beijing or any other location. The time in Beijing changes constantly, and without access to live data, I can't provide you with the exact current time.

However, I can tell you that Beijing is in the China Standard Time (CST) zone, which is UTC+8. This means it's 8 hours ahead of Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).

To find out the current time in Beijing, you can:

1. Use a world clock website or app
2. Search for "time in Beijing" on a search engine
3. Add 8 hours to the current UTC time

If you need to know the exact current time in Beijing for any reason, I recommend checking one of these sources for the most up-to-date information.
