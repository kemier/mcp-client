[2025-04-17T18:34:49.531Z] [INFO] [ChatViewProvider] - Updating chat with message: I apologize, but I don't have real-time information about the current time in Beijing or any other location. As an AI language model, I don't have access to live data or the ability to check the current time.

To find out the current time in Beijing, you can:

1. Use a search engine and type "time in Beijing"
2. Visit a world clock website
3. Use a smartphone app that shows world times
4. Calculate the time difference between your location and Beijing (UTC+8) if you know your local time

Remember that Beijing is in the China Standard Time zone (CST), which is UTC+8. This means it's typically 8 hours ahead of Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).
